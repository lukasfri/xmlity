XMLity is a (de)serialization library for XML, inspired by [Serde](https://serde.rs/) and improves upon XML (de)serialization libraries such as [yaserde](https://github.com/media-io/yaserde) and [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml) by providing a more flexible API that is more powerful, utilising primairly a trial and error approach to parsing XML. This can inherently be a bit slower than other libraries, but it allows for more complex XML structures to be parsed.
